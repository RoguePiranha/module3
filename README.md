# Overview

This web application is designed for making written content posts and sharing photos. Built with Django, it integrates various functionalities such as user authentication, friend requests, feed for posts, likes, and comments. The web app is hosted locally on the computer and can be accessed by opening the web browser and going to the URL http://localhost:8000/. The first page that will be seen is the login page. If you don't have an account, you can click the "Sign Up" button to create an account. Once you have an account, you can login and you will be redirected to the home page. From there, you can navigate to the other pages of the web app.

I wrote this software to learn how to use the Django framework and to learn how to create a web app. I wanted to learn how to create a web app because I think it's a useful skill to have as a software engineer. I also wanted to learn how to use Django because it's a popular framework and I wanted to learn how to use it.

# Web Pages

- Login Page: This is the first page that is seen when the web app is opened. It has a form for the user to enter their username and password. If the user doesn't have an account, they can click the "Not Registered Yet" button to create an account. If the user enters the wrong username or password, an error message will be displayed. If the user enters the correct username and password, they will be redirected to the home page.
- Home Page: This is the page that the user is redirected to after logging in. It displays the user's posts and the posts of the user's friends. The user can also create a new post from this page. The user can also navigate to the other pages of the web app from this page.
- Profile Page: This page displays the user's profile information. The user can also edit their profile information by clicking to the edit profile page from this here.
- Friends Page: This page displays the user's friends. If the user has no friends, they can click a link to a search page to search for other users to add as friends.


# Development Environment

I primarily used Visual Studio Code to develop this project. This allowed me to easily edit the code and see the changes in real time. I also used the terminal in VS Code to run the server and test the web app.

I used the Python Django framework to create the web app. I used the Django templating language to dynamically create the web pages and build the forms and rest of the web app. For the database, I used SQLite3. For the front end, I used HTML and CSS.

# Future Work

- First, I ran into a server error when trying to load the project towards the end. I'm not sure at this moment what's causing the error, but I will look into it and fix it.
- I would like to add more functionality to the web app as well as more diverse pages with different content and maybe a video or gif upload feature.
- I need to work on the CSS and make the web app look more appealing, it's very basic right now and I don't like the look of it.
